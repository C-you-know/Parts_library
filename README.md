# Parts_library
This is an simple intuitive Arduino Library I made for myself. I really prefer OOP in robotics because it makes the code more readable and writable.

The abstraction given by OOP pardigm helps in making the code more intinutive and more resuable.

`Note: Keep this file in the same folder as your ino and add "#include "parts.h" in your .ino file."` 

## Currently Supported Parts:

 - LED
 - DC_Motor(any rpm)
